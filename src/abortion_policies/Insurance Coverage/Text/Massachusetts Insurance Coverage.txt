The state of Massachusetts has a policy in place to use Medicaid funds to pay for abortion, most of these states require coverage for "medically necessary" abortion. This is a vaguely-defined criterion usually based on a decision between a pregnant person and their medical provider and can include circumstances beyond physical health, such as mental or emotional health or familial situations. Medicaid is a federal-state insurance program. Based on the Hyde amendment, states are required to use Medicaid funds to pay for abortion in cases of rape, of incest, or when the pregnant person's life is endangered; these are also the only circumstances in which federal Medicaid funds may be used to pay for abortion.
